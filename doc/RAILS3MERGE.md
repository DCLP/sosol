Notes 2014-06-23:

1. any calls to set_content need to be checked --- either use set_xml_content or add actor info to options. Need to investigate what actor needs to be set to.

2. perseus epidoc stylesheets are not compiling. might be due to discrepancies between version of default epidoc xslt templates referenced from them in this branch the the version used in perseus_shibboleth
