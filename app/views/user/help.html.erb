<h2>Finalizing an item</h2>
<p>
If an item is approved, then it must be finalized. What this entails will vary for each item but it essentially means that one person has the job of reviewing all of the comments and edits and deciding the final result. Once they have made the final edits, then they must click Finalize and the process will be completed. What happens for completion will vary with each item type. The texts will be commited to the repository. The meta will be emailed to James, etc...

<h2>Editorial Boards</h2>
<p>
Editorial boards controll the flow of the item that is being edited. Each board has a title and a category. The category controls which category of item is being edited. Choices are "Meta", "Transcription", or "Translation".
The members are users who are allowed to review and vote on the items.
</p>

<p>
Under normal use there will be and admin for each board who controls the settings. Currently I have set everyone to be an admin.
</p>

<h3>Decrees</h3>
</p>
<p>
 Decrees describe the types of votes, how they are counted and the resulting action. Each decree has an Action, Trigger and Choices.
</p>

<h4>Action</h4>
<p>
This is what happens when the tally is positive for the decree.
</p>

<h4>Trigger</h4>
<p>
This determines how the vote is tallied. For the vote to be a percentage of the total board members enter the value as a decimal percentage, i.e. 0.50 is 50%. For the vote to be an absolute count, use a whole number, i.e. 2 would require that any 2 members vote.
</p>

<h4>Choices</h4>
<p>
This list the choices that count towards the decree. Choices are space separated. The same choice could be used in multiple decrees.
</p>
