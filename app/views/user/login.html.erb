	<h2>Why should I sign up?</h2>

		<li>Edit documents</li>
		<li>Submit documents for publication</li>

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>Instead of creating yet another username and password, <%= SITE_NAME %> will use your AOL, Facebook, Google, or Yahoo account. If you don't have one of these accounts, you can create an OpenID for free at <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/signup">myOpenID.com</a></p>
		
<h4>Do I have to give you my password?</h4>
<p><strong>No.</strong> After entering your info above, you will be taken to service that you picked and enter your password there. Then you will be asked to approve <%= SITE_NAME %> to have limited access to basic information like your username and email address. Finally you will be redirected back here to finish signing up. <strong>We will never have access to your passwords or your accounts.</strong></p>
