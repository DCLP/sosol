  %h2 Why should I sign up?
  Once you sign up or sign in using the form to the left, you'll be able to:
  %ul{ :style => 'margin-left:30px;' }
    %li Edit documents
    %li Submit documents for publication
    %li Publish new documents
    %li Collaborate with other users

%div{ :style => "clear:both", :class => "notification_box" }
  %h4 What is this?
  %p== Instead of creating yet another username and password, #{SITE_NAME} will use your AOL, Facebook, Google, or Yahoo account. If you don't have one of these accounts, you can create an OpenID for free at <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/signup">myOpenID.com</a>
    
  %h4 Do I have to give you my password?
  %p== <strong>No.</strong> After entering your info above, you will be taken to service that you picked and enter your password there. Then you will be asked to approve #{SITE_NAME} to have limited access to basic information like your username and email address. Finally you will be redirected back here to finish signing up. <strong>We will never have access to your passwords or your accounts.</strong>
