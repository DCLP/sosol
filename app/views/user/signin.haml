  #signup_explanation
    %h3 What is this?
    %p!== Instead of creating yet another username and password, #{SITE_NAME} will use your AOL, Google, or Yahoo account. If you don't have one of these accounts, you can create an OpenID for free at <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/signup">myOpenID.com</a>
    
    %h3 Do I have to give you my password?
    %p!== <strong>No.</strong> After entering your info above, you will be taken to the service that you picked and enter your password there. Then you will be asked to approve #{SITE_NAME} to have limited access to basic information like your username and email address. Finally you will be redirected back here to finish signing up. <strong>We will never have access to your passwords or your accounts.</strong>
